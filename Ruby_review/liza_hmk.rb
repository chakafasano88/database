# Explain the relationship between .new() and def initialize().
# The def initialize() method runs when a .new() method is created!

# Define class, subclass, instance, and self.
# Class = an object blueprint
# Sublcass = a class that inherits a parent class
# Instance = an "instance" of a class or subclass
# Self = an instances way of referring to itself

# Properly define instance and class variables.
# Instance Variable = is a varible only available for a class's instance
# Class Variable = shared by all objects of a class

# Properly define instance and class methods.
# Instance method = Method you call on an instance
# Class method = Method available for all objects of a class

# Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to being stored in a local, instance, or class variable.
# Data stored in a class variable is the best option because it can be used by multiple objects !

# Describe the relationship of attr_ and "getter" and "setter" methods.
# attr_getter "gets" the chosen attribute (i.e. color) and attr_getter sets the attribute!

# Distinguish whether a piece of data is best suited to having its accessibility defined by attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor or none of the above.
# attr_accessor is the best choice for accessibility becuase it bypasses having to create instance methods, or using attr_reader, attr_writer to create attributes! This is a great shortcut and save the programmer time !
